to make code more consistent, shine bright on lens to reduce sensitivity then save via net connection in settings

determine threshold values for LEDs using the NI Vision Assistant- take pictures w/camera, load to the Vision Assistant and apply Color Threshold operation. double-click on color threshold icon and a set of sliders will pop up representing the HSL values. adjust sliders to get the upper and lower HSL values. to findsettings that only detect the color of your light source. The constants in the programbelow represent the values for our red LEDs, you need to find your own values for your light source. Once you have the values, they can be used in your program.

BinaryImage binImage = colorImage.thresholdHSL(242, 255, 36, 255, 25, 255);

The two image operations used in the code are:
1. A color threshold operation returns a binary image (single bit/pixel) with the bit set in
the output for each corresponding pixel that is within the specified range.
2. A particle analysis that takes a binary image and finds groups (blobs) of pixels.
These correspond to areas of red light.
