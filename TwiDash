SmartDashboard is a seperate program from NI's dashboard.

how to switch on/off

after installing 
in the Folder "C:/Program Files/Dashboard/"
there will be the files
NIDashBoard.exe :original 
DashBoard.exe   :runs Launcher.bat//COOL INDIAN SONG:tharti hilida aman hayer
Launcher.bat    :launches smartdashboard

The Driver Station autoruns dashboard.exe whatever it is.

Delete Dashboard.exe
Rename NIDashboard.exe
move Launcher.bat to the desktop

Now the default is the regular dashboard, if you want the smart one just exit the default and run Launcher.bat
